## congressbr

congressbr is a package for extracting data from the APIs of the Brazilian Federal Senate and Chamber of Deputies, respectively. 

### installation

As of yet, congressbr is not on CRAN. It can be installed with the devtools package: 

```{r, eval = F}

devtools::install_github("RobertMyles/congressbr")

```

### function naming

We follow [googlesheets](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets) in using a naming convention for functions that facilitates tab completion. All Senate-related functions start with `sen_` and all Chamber-related ones start with `cam_` ('CÃ¢mara'). 

   
  
This package is under development and contributions are welcome. The API of the Federal Senate is also under development, and so elements of this package may change.
