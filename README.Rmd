## congressbr

congressbr is a package for extracting data from the APIs of the Brazilian Federal Senate and Chamber of Deputies, respectively. 

### function naming

We follow [googlesheets](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets) in using a naming convention for functions that facilitates tab completion. All Senate-related functions start with `sen_` and all Chamber-related ones start with `cam_` ('CÃ¢mara').
